To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/ciderapp/node_airtunes2/security/advisories/new) tab. 
Please be as descriptive as possible and provide methods to reproduce and screenshots where possible.

We will try our best to handle every security report that comes in, please remember that we are a fairly small team with varying work efforts so bear this in mind when making the report.
